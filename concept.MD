##Basic Story
Krampus is meeting his girlfriend at the xmas markt to do some holiday shopping, so that he can find something for his best friend St. Nicholaus. He hops on his bike to the Xmas market. After arrival, he starts his shopping while waiting for the girlfriend. He finds something good for St. Nic, and then receives a text message from his girlfriend.s Unfortunately she will not be coming today, and she would like to break up with Krampus. Even worse, she is now seeing his best friend, St. Nic. Krampus gets upset at the girlfriend and his friend Nic and leaves the market, only to find his bike was stolen.

As he is walking away with a broken heart and no bicycle, he bumps into a girl (monster) who just had her bike stolen as well. Krampus offers her the present he bought for St. Nic to cheer her up, and they walk off together. They immediately spend more time together, fast forward a year and they have a child. But Krampus and St. Nic are still not speaking, and Christmas just doesn't have the same jingle that is used to.

##Remaining Questions?
- Should this be narrated (Think [The Big lebowski](http://bednark.com/big.lebowski.script.html), Arrested development)?
- Krampus' costume:
	- Just a mask with long red tongue, maybe horns?
	- Rest of his outfit - keep with dark colors, but obviously normal clothes?
	- Bundle of sticks and chains
		- is he carrying them because he is a Krampus, and that's why they do (like nerds with fanny packs)
		- is he carrying them coincidentally (take sticks out to garbage)
		- does he gradually lose them throughout the movie (gives up chains so she can lock her bike, drops sticks to hold hands with girl)
- Same mask for girl monster?
- Just horns for baby Krampus?
- Combine scenes 5, 6?

##Scene 1
Introducing Krampus

Location: Krampus' apartment

- - -

###Need to establish some basic details:
- Krampus is part (obviously) Krampus, part human
- Krampus is largely a normal guy though, aside from the need to carry a bundle of sticks and chains everywhere he goes
- Krampus has a girlfriend, and is going to meet her to shop for his best friend
- Krampus' best friend is St. Nic
	- (optionally) wasn't scary enough to be a real Krampus, so they just hang out?

###Shots:
- Krampus face isn't revealed in this scene
- Opens zoomed in on some Christmas object (the star, a tree)
- Slowly zooms out to reveal rest of apartment.
- There are family photos on the wall, introducing the Krampus characters (mom and dad (human, and Krampus)
- Picture of his girlfriend on the nightstand
- His dog in scene
- Picture of Dog with name 'Snoopy' next to other photos
- Show calendar with date circled ("Date with ____")
- Obviously a bachelor pad though - empty beer bottles, pizza box? (Need to show more sophisticated apartment later)
- Gradually you can hear Krampus in the background getting ready. Maybe he is singing in the shower?
- Getting dressed to go out. All POV footage at this point, so you see him making his shopping list, reading letter from his girlfriend, etc. grabbing scarf, keys, gloves, 
- Scene ends with him grabbing his bundle of sticks, chains, and walking out the door.

###Music Ideas
Super positive, something that builds over the scene. Maybe "walking on sunshine"
